# Hangman
This is a simple Hangman game using Python programming language.
The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words.
The random module will provide this ability, so line 1 in program imports it
Hangman is a popular word game in which one player (the "chooser") chooses a secret word and another player (the "guesser") attempts to guess the word one letter at a time.
If a guessed letter appears in the word, all instances of it are revealed. If not, the guesser loses a chance.
